This project deals with a portfolio investment simulation. In this project I've used 6 stocks from differents markets.
> Implementation language: R

> Software: RStudio Version 1.4.1106

Project phases:
- Data summary: an introduction with the chosen financial instruments and motivations (e.g. a set of relevant news).
- Descriptive analytics: a section organized in different subsections summarizing the main results from exploratory
data analysis including returns, variances and covariances at different time scale (daily, weekly, monthly).
- Predictive analytics: a section organized in different subsections summarizing the time-series mining approaches
(e.g. price forecasting, return forecasting, etc. )
- Compute the “beta” for the chosen stocks
- Portfolio management: the investments decisions and the return on its own “virtual” portfolio, including transaction
costs
- Portfolio management via mean-variance
- Trading based on forecasting
- Web applet for data visualization of multiple task (using tools as Rshiny and Dash)
- Conclusions: general comments about data, analytical process and results.
